# First implementation (28/03/2020)
The first strategy that I have implemented if using conditional to control lineal and angular speed.
Ad hoc, I used openCV to find the center points of the red line in two differents heights. Using
tree differents ranges I try to keep points in the middle of the image, thus keep thew car following the line.
